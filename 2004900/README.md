Differences with model


-Fillets: 2D sketch for the pockets differ in the two holes for support, as .60R fillets would alter geometry. Some corners have been left as is. 
-Ribs: there is still some doubt about the rib's thickness, as it doesn't match the internal ones. 
-Part numbering mark not added into model.
